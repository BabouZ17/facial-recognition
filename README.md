# facial-recognition
Python facial recognition example.

This example uses the dimensionality reduction principle. As a reminder, there are several technics to process a dimension reduction:
 
	1.Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
		* Unlabeled.
		* Axis of maximum variance or spread.	
	2.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with fisherfaces algorithm.
		* Labeled.
		* Axis of maximum class or category separation.
	3. Local Binary Patterns (LBP).
